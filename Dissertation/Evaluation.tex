\section{Overview}
\label{evalOverview}
The evaluation of this project focuses on the performance of the computer player. The main method of evaluation is test runs - running the game with certain players/parameters and gathering data about the performance of the player being tested. No user evaluation was done, for either the game client or the computer player. In terms of the game client, usability was not one of the goals. As for the computer player, it is not strong enough to be evaluated in terms of the quality of the moves it makes. This becomes evident quickly when playing against it - it rarely makes good moves, skewing heavily towards making few attacks per turn, even passing over obvious opportunities to gain an advantage - such as capturing a continent with little to no risk or cost.
