\textbf{Abstract}\\
\vspace*{1cm}

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.9\linewidth}
This paper describes the development of a digital game client and a computer player for the strategy board game "Risk". The computer player utilizes a combination of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and rule-based approaches. It regularly makes reasonable, logical moves, but is computationally inefficient, and therefore sometimes fails to find a good move. The game client is a minimal, but full-featured program that allows for player vs computer, computer vs computer, and player vs player (hotseat) play. The paper showcases the design features and implementation steps of both the client and the computer player, and describes the evaluation process together with its results. Finally, this report provides suggestions for future work, both on this project and possible future projects in the same problem space, and outlines lessons learned.
